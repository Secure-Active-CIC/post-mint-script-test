<h3>NOT FOR USE - TESTING</h3>

Love Mint? Tired of post installation configuration? 

This is a post installation script for Mint Linux for a mildly security conscious box

This is a script to tighten up the security on a standard Mint box post installation. In addition popular security focused apps are installed...or at least, you're given the opportunity to install.

The threat model is a modicum of resilience against an opportunitistic adversary looking for low hanging fruit. 

If you're security needs are greater than this contact Secure Active on <a href="mailto:info@secure.coop?Subject=Security%20help" target="_top">info@secure.coop</a>

<code>wget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Secure-Active-CIC/post-mint-script-test/master/install.sh</code>
