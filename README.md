NOT FOR USE - TESTING

Post installation script for Mint Linux for a mildly security conscious box

Love Mint? Tired of post installation configuration? 

This is a script to tighten up the security on a standard Mint box post installation. In addition popular security focused apps are installed...or you're given the opportunity to install.

This was created on a rainy bank holiday weekend and is not recommend for use...yet.
