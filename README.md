Post installation script for Mint Linux for a mildly security conscious box

Love Mint? Tired of post installation configuration? 

This is a script to tighten up the security on a standard Mint box post installation. In addition popular security focused apps are installed...or you're given the opportunity to install.

This was created on a rainy bank holiday weekend and is not recommend for use...yet.

<h1>Instructions</h1>

Open a terminal and enter the following:

<code>wget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Secure-Active-CIC/post-mint-script-test/master/install.sh</code>

<code>chmod +x install.sh</code>

<code>sudo ./install.sh</code>
