<h3>NOT FOR USE - TESTING</h3>

Love Mint? Tired of post installation configuration? 

This script is to reduce some of the work post-installtion. Designed for a mildly security conscious box.

This is a script to tighten up the security and add some common security focussed apps.

The threat model is a modicum of resilience against an opportunitistic adversary looking for low hanging fruit. 

If you're security needs are greater than this, and you're doing socially positive work, contact Secure Active on <a href="mailto:info@secure.coop?Subject=Security%20help" target="_top">info@secure.coop</a>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

Open a terminal and enter the following:

<code>wget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Secure-Active-CIC/post-mint-script-test/master/install.sh</code>

<code>chmod +x install.sh</code>

<code>sudo ./install.sh</code>
